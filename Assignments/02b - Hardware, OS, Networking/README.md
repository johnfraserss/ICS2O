_Mr. Lightbody's class might set up this differently.  See your teacher for more details_

Clients
-------

### Client 1
> Hello! I am looking for some help with regards to my computing needs at the office.  I know that we will be needing 2 computers for ourselves, and there will be contractors that come in and will be using their own laptops.  They will need connectivity to the network printer while they are in the building.  
> 
> For the two computers, our needs are as follows:
> * We need the fastest, most graphically powerful computer that you can create for us.
> * We need a lot of space on the computers, and a couple of external hard drives would also prove useful.
> * Some specialized equipment we will need is a Wacom tablet, and the best audio system you can find.
> * We like consistency and prefer Windows, but if we were to take on Linux, it would have to be a user-friendly distribution.
> * We need a new network printer, just something to print off black and white copies of our work, as we get our colour prints done professionally off-site.
> 
> We figured we could also have a TV-screen set up in our foyer where customers wait, but have it connected to a really cheap computer that is network capable.  This way we can put updates, show our art, etc. on the TV screen.
> 
> We create assets for a local game creation company (Client #2), so we will need to be able to get them assets easily.  Do you have any suggestions?


### Client 2
> Hi!
> 
> I am cheap... super cheap.  I need 5 computers that are powerful enough to play the newest games, but I only need to run Linux.  We love tinkering with programs, would are okay with setting things up on Linux.
> 
> As a computer programmer, myself and my 4 colleagues are going to need similar computers.  We tend to use a lot of Git (version control software), and GitHub to complete our work and collaborate.  We will need the best network system and connectivity that you can set up for us.
> 
> The programs we tend to make are highly graphically intensive, and are going to be taking up a lot of space. We will also need a network storage system (NAS) to hold on to all of the assets that we are getting created for us by our artists (Client #1).
> 
> We also tend to prefer mechanical keyboards, and a mouse with many button options so that we can set up macros to speed up our work.


Package
--------
### Section 1 (Title Page)  
A title page (1 page) including:
* Your name, 
* the course code, 
* a title for your work, 
* which client you were assigned,
 
### Section 2 (Table of Contents)  
A table of contents (1-2 pages), complete this at the end after you have completed every other section.

### Section 3 (Abstract)  
An abstract about the paperwork in the next few pages.  This is usually a summary of what is included in the entire package, including a basic conclusion on decisions made.

### Section 4 (Proposed System)  
This section will be the largest of all sections, and will include:
* A paragraph describing the client's needs in your own words followed by,
* A table (or tables) that shows the hardware and software choices, including part type, product name, where you plan to buy the item and price (1-3 pages).
* Include hyperlinks for your prices.  If you are unsure of how to add a hyperlink, a short lesson will be available for you.

### Section 5 (Networking)
This is a written section that includes: 
* Describe the network that the client would need to set up.  
* Topology choice
* Whether a client-server or peer-to-peer setup would be better.
* What hardware you would purchase to set up the network.
* What networking applications and protocols would prove useful for the clients.
* Describe a file sharing methodology that works for your clients.

### Section 6 (Software and Structuring)
This is a written and visual section as follows:
* Describe what applications the client could possibly need.  Include current pricing (hyperlink the price to your source).
* Describe a folder structure that you could suggest to the client.  Feel free to include a visual of this if you find it easier.

### Section 7 (Reasoning)  
This section will include reasoning behind your choices in _Section 4_, _Section 5_, and _Section 6_

### Section 8 (Reflection)
This section will be a written reflection answering the following questions:
* What was the most difficult part of completing this project?
* What did you learn from completing this project?
* Would you have preferred to complete this project for the other _Client_? Why or why not?

### Section 9 (Sources)
* Cite any of your sources here using either APA, MLA, or Chicago Style formatting.

### Important notes
* All pages should have a page number at the bottom, excluding the first page.
* For _Section 4_ and _Section 5_, you have to purchase individual parts, and **not** all-in-one solutions.
* **DO NOT PRINT THIS WORK** - See the _Submissables_ section for more details


Submissables & Due Date(s)
----------
**Mr. Seidel's Class**: Package due to IN drive by February 27th, 2017 at 2:46pm.  
**Mr. Lightbody's Class**: See your teacher for due dates and how to submit your work

Rubric(s)
---------
**Your teacher might use a different rubric than below.  Please see your teacher for information.**

How to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_A1_, _A2_, _A3_, and _A4_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _A1.1_, _A1.2_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _A1.1_, _A1.2_, _A1.3_, and _A1.4_ will be used to generate a level for section _A1_. and so on through the various sections.
