###Client #1
Hello! I am looking for some help on purchasing my next computer system.  
My needs are as follows:
* I need the fastest, most graphically powerful computer that you can create for me.
* I don't like alternative operating systems, and prefer Windows.
* I have 3 other people working for me at my company, but they will be providing their own laptops to complete their work.
* I need a network printer, just something to print off black and white copies of work.
*   

###Client #2
Hi!

I am cheap... super cheap.  I need 5 computers that will run Linux, but I don't want to deal with setting up a lot of different little things on the system.

I tend to complete a lot of programming, as do my 4 colleagues in the building.  We all need similar computers so that we can create programs together.

We will also need a network storage system (NAS) to hold on to all of the assets that we are going to be creating for one of our new video games we are planning to release.


Package
--------
**Section 1:** A title page (1 page)
**Section 2:** A table of contents (1-2 pages)
**Section 3:** An abstract about the paperwork in the next few pages.  This is usually a summary of what is included in the entire package, including a basic conclusion on decisions made.
**Section 4:** A table that shows the hardware and software choices, including part type, product name, where you plan to buy the item and price (1-3 pages)
**Section 5:** A written paragraph that describes the reasoning behind your choices in _Section 4_.
**Section 6:** Describe the network that the client would need to set up.  Include a topology choice, and what hardware you would purchase to set up the network.

_Note:_ For _Section 4_, you have to purchase individual parts, and **not** all-in-one computers.
