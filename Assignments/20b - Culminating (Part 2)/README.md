**This task is worth 10% of your final mark (10 of the 30% culminating mark)**

1. Create a document that reflects on the previous non-programming assignments.  Your specific tasks for each section are below:
  * Post Secondary: What was the purpose of this assignment? Do you believe that the career(s) you chose are career(s) that you would be interested in pursuing? Why/Why not?
  * Hardware: What purpose did this assignment have in relation to the computer programming that you completed?  What did you learn from this assignment?
  * Operating Systems: Why would someone choose a Linux system over the other two mainstream options (Mac OS or Windows)?  Would you ever choose Linux for yourself? Why/Why not?
  * Networking: Describe how you would live your day-to-day lives if the internet went out of existence tomorrow.
  * SDLC and Flowcharting: What portions of the SDLC did you complete this year?  How often did you complete the SDLC for your programming projects rather than just jumping directly into the coding portion?  What might have been different if you had completed the Analysis and Design portions first (including flowcharting)?
  * Ethics: Why is it important for computer programmers to have a code of ethics?
  * Environmental: Would you change the way that you deal with electronics if you knew that the planet would crumble into chaos 10 years from now, based on our waste of electronics?  Why/why not?
