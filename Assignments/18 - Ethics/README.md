Rubric(s)
---------
**Your teacher might use a different rubric than below.  Please see your teacher for information.**
<br/><br/>

Your mark will be calculated as follows: __Mark = R * C__ where R is the value of the rubric, and C is whether you followed the criteria above.

| Descriptor | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | R |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C3.1 - describe legal or ethical issues related to the use of the computer | | | | | |
| C3.2 - describe safeguards for preventing unethical use of computers | | | | | |
| Storyline is plausible, and people aren't just reading a script | | | | | |

1. If you are absent without a legitimate reason (a doctor's note required), you will receive a mark of zero on your presentation without the option to present again.
2. If at least one member of the group is available, that person will be expected to present, and will receive full marks for their work. For those that are absent, see #1 above.
3. All group members are expected to contribute equally in all aspects of this project.
