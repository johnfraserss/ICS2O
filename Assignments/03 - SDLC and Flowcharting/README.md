Task(s)
-------
You have been asked to create a computer program based on the following:

_A representative from the government has asked you to create an online voting system for a federal election across Canada._

Using your knowledge of flowcharting and the SDLC complete the following tasks:  
* Create a flowchart of how this system would work (Flowcharting)  
* Create a **basic** sample design of how the system would look (Visual depiction of a few screens of the system).

You can access the notes in class from [this website](https://mrseidel.gitbooks.io/intro-computer-studies-using-processing-and-python/content/Other%20Topics/sdlc_and_flowcharting.html)

For creating flowcharts, there are some tools available online such as:

Submissables & Due Date(s)
----------
**Mr. Seidel's Class**: Due March 3rd, 2017 by 3pm to the IN drive.  
**Mr. Lightbody's Class**: See your teacher for due dates and how to submit your work

Rubric(s)
---------
Example of how to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_B1_, _B2_ and _B3_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _B2.1_, _B2.3_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _B2.1_, and _B2.3_ will be used to generate a level for section _B2_. and so on through the various sections.

| | R | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**B1: describe fundamental programming concepts** | | | | | |
|B1.1: use correct terminology | | | | | |
|B1.4: determine the expressions and instructions to use in a program, taking into account the order of operations (proper order of a flowchart) | | | | | |
|**B2: plan simple programs using fundamental programming concepts;** | | | | | |
|B2.1 use a visual problem-solving model (e.g., diagram; flow chart) to plan the content of a program (well-formatted flowchart and design) | | | | | |
|B2.3: create screen outputs (designs) that conform to program specification; | | | | | |
|**B3: apply basic code maintenance techniques when writing program plans** | | | | | |
|B3.3: use a tracing technique to understand program flow and to identify and correct logic (flowchart is clear and you can easily trace the flow) | | | | | |
