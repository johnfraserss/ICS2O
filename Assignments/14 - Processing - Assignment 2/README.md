Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)

* Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, and looping structures recreate the sketch found in the OUT\Seidel\ICS2O\Assignment 2 folder
* You **must** use ```for``` loops or ```while``` loops to generate the circles, and to generate the 3x3 grid at the mouse.
* If you don't use loops (i.e. type out all of the ellipses and/or rectangles as separate items), your maximum mark is a Level 1
* If you complete only one half (top or bottom) of the assignment, your maximum mark is a Level 2 (regardless of whether you complete the **non-challenge** or **challenge** versions)
* If you complete the **non-challenge** version of this assignment, your maximum mark is a Level 3+
* If you complete the **challenge** version of this assignment, your maximum mark is a Level 4
