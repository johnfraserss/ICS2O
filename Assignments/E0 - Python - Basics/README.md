#### This tutorial will help you get started with creating Python programs.



1. Open _Applications_ ![icon](http://mrseidel.com/images/Python/icons/icon_applications.png)  
2. Open _Python 2 GUI_![icon](http://mrseidel.com/images/Python/icons/icon_python_2.png) (if _Python 2 GUI_ doesn't work, use _Python 3 GUI_)

After opening the Python 2 GUI, it should pop up a screen that looks like this:  
![window](http://mrseidel.com/images/Python/icons/python_shell.png)



You can type small commands in this window, but this is not where you want to be doing the majority of your work.  Instead, you will want to _Click on New_ as shown in the picture below:

After clicking on new, it should open a brand new window for you to type your program(s) in, as below:  
![text editor window](http://mrseidel.com/images/Python/icons/python_new_file.png)



Within this window, you will type up your programs.  Once you are ready to test your programs, you will click on _Run_ -> _Run Module (F5)_ as shown below:

After running your program, the output will show up in the Shell screen. See below for an example program that prints _hello_ to the console:
