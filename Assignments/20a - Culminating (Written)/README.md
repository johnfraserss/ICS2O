Task(s)
-------

**This task is worth 10% of your final mark (10 of the 30% culminating mark)**

Create a **website** that contains the following **webpages** with a menu connecting them all.  On each webpage, you will be reflecting on the previous non-programming assignments.  Your specific page reflections for each section are below:
* __Post Secondary__: Do you ever see yourself creating programs in the future (beyond all of your school plans)?  Why/Why not?
* __Hardware__: Why is hardware important to a computer programmer? What did you learn from this assignment?
* __Operating Systems__: Microsoft and Apple go bankrupt, leaving the world only one operating system choice: Linux.  Explain which distribution you would choose, and how you would make the transition to Linux.  If neither Microsoft nor Apple actually disappeared, would you ever choose Linux for yourself? Why/Why not?
* __Networking__: The internet and cell phones no longer work.  The only communication device available is a landline phone, or a telegraph.  Describe how you would adapt to your new lifestyle.
* __SDLC and Flowcharting__: Regarding your programming, how often did you complete the _analysis_ or _design_ portion of the SDLC?  How many flowcharts did you make?  Would it have helped at all if you did either of these? Why/why not?
* __Ethics__: Why bother? Why do we care what people do on their computers?  Explain the world if there was no code of ethics.
* __Environmental__: According to environmental resources, we are approaching the _Sixth Mass Extinction Event_ ([source][1], [source][2], [source][3], [source][4], [source][5], [source][6],) within the next 20-150 years (depending on source). What do _you_ **_actually_** plan to do about it?
