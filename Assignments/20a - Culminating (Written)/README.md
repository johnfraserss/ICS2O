Task(s)
-------

**This task is worth 10% of your final mark (10 of the 30% culminating mark)**

1. Create a **website** that contains the following **webpages** with a menu connecting them all.  On each webpage, you will be reflecting on the previous non-programming assignments.  Your specific page reflections for each section are below:
* __Post Secondary__: Do you ever see yourself creating programs in the future (beyond all of your school plans)?  Why/Why not?
* __Hardware__: Why is hardware important to a computer programmer? What did you learn from this assignment?
* __Operating Systems__: Microsoft and Apple go bankrupt, leaving the world only one operating system choice: Linux.  Explain which distribution you would choose, and how you would make the transition to Linux.  If neither Microsoft nor Apple actually disappeared, would you ever choose Linux for yourself? Why/Why not?
* __Networking__: If the internet, and cellular technology disappeared tomorrow, describe how you would live your day-to-day life in the wake of this aftermath.
* __SDLC and Flowcharting__: How often did you complete the analysis and design portions of the SDLC? Why was/wasn't it prevalent in your programming work? 
* __Ethics__: Why is a code of ethics needed for computer programmers?
* __Environmental__: Assume 10 years from now e-waste will destroy the planet.  What can you _**actually**_ do now to stop this from happening?
