Task(s)
-------

1. Create a document that reflects on the previous non-programming assignments.  Your specific tasks for each section are below:
  * Post Secondary: What was the purpose of this assignment? Do you believe that the career(s) you chose are career(s) that you would be interested in pursuing? Why/Why not?
  * Hardware: What relation did this assignment have in relation to the computer programming that you completed?  What did you learn from this assignment?
  * Operating Systems: How many different operating systems are there?  Why would someone chose a Linux system over the other two mainstream options (Mac OS or Windows)?  Would you ever chose Linux for yourself? Why/Why not?
  * Acronyms: What was the purpose of this assignment?
  * SDLC and Flowcharting: What portions of the SDLC did you complete this year?  How often did you complete the SDLC for your programming projects rather than just jumping directly into the coding portion?  What might have been different if you had completed the Analysis and Design portions first (including flowcharting)?
  * Ethics: Why is it important for computer programmers to have a code of ethics?
  * Environmental: Why is it important to consider the environment when dealing with electronics?  Would you change the way that you deal with electronics if you knew that the planet would crumble in the next 10 years if we all continued the way we were now?  Why/why not?
  * Networking: Describe what you think the world would be like now if the internet did not exist.  How much of your daily life is spent using the internet in some way?  How would you survive without the internet?
