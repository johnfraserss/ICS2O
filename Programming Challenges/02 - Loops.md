Programming in Processing Challenges
-------

The following will give you practice with _for loops_

1. Create a program that draws 100 circles of random colours to the screen.  The fill values should not change over time.
2. Create a program that draws 100 lines originating from the center of the screen of random lengths, and of random colours.  The fill values should not change over time.
3. Create a program that draws 100 triangles, where each new triangle is connected to the previous triangle on 1 point.  All triangles should have a random fill colour that does not change over time.
