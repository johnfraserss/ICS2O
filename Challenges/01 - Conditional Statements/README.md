###Processing Practice

The following will give you practice with _if statements_

1. Create a program that changes the background colour of each quadrant as you mouse-over the area.
2. Create a program that has a circle follow your mouse, unless your mouse is on the right half of the screen.  At which point the mouse should only follow the vertical motion of your mouse.
3. Create a program that displays a different shape in the middle of the screen depending on where your mouse is (include ellipse, rect, line, and triangle).
4. Create a program that has a circle bouncing left and right off of the screen edges.
5. Create a program that has a circle bouncing left and right off of the screen edges and changes to another colour if the mouse is over the circle.

###Python Practice

1. Create a program that receives one word, and one integer (less than 100).  Have the program repeat the word an amount of times equal to the integer. (e.g. if the word was "lol" and the number was 5, then the output would be "lollollollollol")
2. Create a program that receives a single number.  Output whether that number is odd or even.
