Within this course we will be making use of the Software/System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). For the majority of the projects in this course you will be required to analyse the given information, go through the creation of a design (graphical interface or not), **_before_** proceeding into the coding portion of your work.


The 5 phases as described above can be defined as follows:

###Requirement Analysis:
This is the time you figure out what the client is **actually** looking for in their end product.

###Design:
Create a drawn out design, or a mock-up interface to show the client. Also, ensure that your design will cover all the objectives as figured out in the analysis.

###Implementation/Coding:
This is the main section where you will be creating the program itself.

###Testing:
This is where you test your code. It is always a good idea to have your peers test out your code to see if they can break it under normal usage patterns. Your teacher will be willing to test your program once prior to your submission of your work, as long as it is a few days before the due date.

###Evolution/Update:
This phase will be where updates to your program are completed, or even updates (such as new feature requests, etc.)

The majority of the course will take place in the Analysis, Design, Coding, and Testing phases.
